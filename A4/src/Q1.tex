\section*{Part 1: Camera Calibration}

The goal of part 1 is to calibrate a camera.
Fortunately, this has already been completed as part of my research work in AFRL.
Therefore, I am choosing to rely on that previous work for this section.
I have provided the results of one of those calibrations below where $A$ is the intrinsic camera matrix and $D$ is a vector of distortion coefficients.

\begin{align*}
  A & =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1294.866972 & 0           & 812.94462  \\
    0           & 1288.781405 & 608.304958 \\
    0           & 0           & 1
  \end{pmatrix} \\
  D & =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0.17655 & -0.298498 & 0.000473 & -0.000956 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

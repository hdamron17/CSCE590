CSCE 590 Assignment 1
=====================

This software uses OpenCV to do several basic image processing operations for CSCE 590.

To make the code and produce a PDF, cd into a directory `Release` and run `cmake ..` followed by `make`. The resultant pdf will be in the build directory.

If this fails, you may try to run each command manually then rerun `cmake ..` and `make` (dependencies got kind of funky)
`./bin/A1_Q1 ../A1 && ./bin/A1_Q2 ..//A1 && ./bin/A1_Q4 ../A1`

For convenience, a premade pdf is provided in the `doc` directory and the cpp and tex files resulting from notangle/noweave can be found in the noweb directory.
